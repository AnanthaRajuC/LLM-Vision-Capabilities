ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Examine the crop type, growth stage, and overall health carefully
2. Look for signs of disease, pests, or stress (yellowing, spots, wilting, damage)
3. Assess field organization, planting patterns, and management practices
4. Note environmental factors like terrain, weather, and surrounding elements
5. **Carefully scan the entire image for people - look for human figures, workers, farmers, or anyone present in the agricultural setting**
6. **Count the number of people visible and describe their activities if observable (planting, harvesting, weeding, inspecting crops, etc.)**
7. **Provide a confidence score for people detection based on image clarity and visibility**
8. **Thoroughly examine the image for agricultural equipment and machinery - look for tractors, harvesters, plows, sprayers, irrigation systems, tillers, seeders, or any farming implements**
9. **Count and categorize all visible equipment, assess their condition and current usage status**
10. **Provide detailed descriptions and confidence scores for equipment detection**
11. **Carefully scan for any animals in the agricultural setting - look for cattle, poultry (chickens, ducks, geese), goats, sheep, pigs, horses, or other livestock**
12. **Also check for wild animals that might be present in or around the farming area**
13. **Count animals by category, describe their behavior, health indicators, and their relationship to the crops (grazing, separate enclosures, mixed farming)**
14. **Assess whether animals are part of an integrated farming system or separate from crop production**
15. **Provide confidence scores for animal detection and identification**
16. Provide practical recommendations based on visible conditions
12. Include detailed descriptions in each section for better semantic search capability
13. Add semantic tags that capture key agricultural concepts
14. Create a search context summary that combines multiple aspects
15. Use null values for any field that cannot be determined from the image
16. Ensure confidence scores reflect your certainty in each assessment
