ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Examine the crop type, growth stage, and overall health carefully
2. Look for signs of disease, pests, or stress (yellowing, spots, wilting, damage)
3. Assess field organization, planting patterns, and management practices
4. Note environmental factors like terrain, weather, and surrounding elements
5. Provide practical recommendations based on visible conditions
6. Use null values for any field that cannot be determined from the image
7. Ensure confidence scores reflect your certainty in each assessment
